# Harnessing the Power of the Pulumi Automation API

The Pulumi Automation API is an advanced feature of the Pulumi Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that was developed to solve a number of problems associated with the management, deployment, and automation of cloud resources.

The Automation API allows developers to define infrastructure programmatically, which is in contrast to traditional IaC approaches that require configuration files or domain-specific languages (DSLs). Essentially, it's a robust and fully-featured software library for creating and managing Pulumi stacks, and can be used within your software code like any other package or library.
